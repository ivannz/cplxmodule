# CplxModule

A lightweight extension for `torch.nn` that adds layers and activations, which respect algebraic operations over the field of complex numbers.

The core implementation of the complex-valued batch normalization and weight initialization layers is based on the ICLR 2018 parer by Chiheb Trabelsi et al. on Deep Complex Networks _[1]_ and borrows ideas from their [implementation](https://github.com/ChihebTrabelsi/deep_complex_networks) (`nn.init`, `nn.modules.batchnorm`). Real-valued variational dropout and automatic relevance determination are original implementations based on the profound works by Diederik Kingma et al. (2015) _[2]_, Dmitry Molchanov et al. (2017) _[3]_, and Valery Kharitonov et al. (2018) _[4]_. Complex-valued Bayesian sparsification layers are based on [original research](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/nazarov20a.html) _[5]_.

# Installation

You can install this package with `pip`:
```bash
pip install cplxmodule
```
or from the git repo to get the latest version:
```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/ivannz/cplxmodule.git
```
If you prefer a developer install (editable), then run the following from the root of the locally cloned repo
```bash
pip install -e .
```

# Documentation

Please refer to README files located in `cplxmodule.nn`, `cplxmodule.nn.relevance`, and `cplxmodule.nn.masked` for a high-level description of the implementation, functionality and useful code patterns.
